## Greasemonkey "More User Info" Script

This [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/) userscript enhances the user info page on Wikidot (e.g. https://www.wikidot.com/user:info/aismallard) by exposing information about the user which is publicly available but is annoying to regularly access within Wikidot.

**You can [install the script](https://github.com/scpwiki/user-info-script/raw/refs/heads/main/user-info.user.js) here.**
