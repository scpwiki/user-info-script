## Greasemonkey "More User Info" Script

This [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/) userscript enhances the user info page on Wikidot (e.g. https://www.wikidot.com/user:info/aismallard) by exposing additional information about users.

It also exposes convenient links, one to navigate to the SCP Wiki user profile page and one to open the site member modal. If you are on a particular site, this shows you site-specific information like membership. This is primarily useful on per-site user pages like [on the SCP Wiki](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:user/aismallard).
